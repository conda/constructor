## You can provide `welcome_image` to a 1200x600 PNG file
## Ideally, transparent background with your logo on the
## bottom left corner.
# welcome_image: ../../constructor/osx/MacInstaller.png
## If you don't want any logo, disable it explicitly:
welcome_image: ""
## If you want an autogenerated logo with the package name
## and version, you need to be explicit about it:
welcome_image_text: osxpkgtest
## Note that if both `welcome_image` and `welcome_image_text`
## are provided, `welcome_image` takes precedence.
