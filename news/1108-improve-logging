### Enhancements

* Improve logging experience for EXE installers: (#1108)
    - Use `cmd.exe` to run commands so that outputs are captured.
    - Output command output in CLI installations.
    - Prevent log builds from writing to log before installation directory exists.
    - Remove registry entries while installation directory still exists so that errors are logged.
