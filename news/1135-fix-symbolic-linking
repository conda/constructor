### Bug fixes

* [#1090](https://github.com/conda/constructor/pull/1090) introduced symbolic linking of `_conda`. This fails the whole installer, if the `_conda` file (or link) exists at the target location. [#1135](https://github.com/conda/constructor/pull/1135) fixes this, by forcing (`-f`) the symlink.
