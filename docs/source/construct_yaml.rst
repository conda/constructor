======================================================
Using construct.yaml files to customize your installer
======================================================

This document describes each of they keys in the `construct.yaml` file,
which is the main configuration file of a constructor configuration
directory.

All keys are optional, except otherwise noted.  Also, the keys `specs`
and `packages` take either a list of items, or a path to a file,
which contains one item per line (excluding lines starting with `#`).

Also note, that any line in `construct.yaml` may contain a selector at the
end, in order to allow customization for selected platforms.

Finally, `construct.yaml` is parsed as a `jinja2` template and so any valid
`jinja2` templating directives may be used. The current shell environment
is available as the `jinja2` variable `environ`. As an example, setting the
`version` key from an environment variable called `VERSION` would look like:
`version: {{ environ["VERSION"] }}`. Note that the special environment variables
available in `meta.yaml` when running `conda-build` are not available here.

Keys
----

~~~~
name
~~~~

required: True

argument type(s): ``str``,

Name of the installer.  May also contain uppercase letter.  The installer
name is independent of the names of any of the conda packages the installer
is composed of.

~~~~~~~
version
~~~~~~~

required: True

argument type(s): ``str``,

Version of the installer.  Just like the installer name, this version
is independent of any conda package versions contained in the installer.

~~~~~~~~
channels
~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``list``,

The conda channels from which packages are retrieved, when using the `specs`
key below, but also when using the `packages` key ,unless the full URL is
given in the `packages` list (see below).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
channels_remap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``list``,

List of `(src, dest)` channels, from which, channels from `src` are also
considered while running solver, but are replaced by corresponding values from
dest when writing `urls{,.txt}`. Example use:

.. code-block::

    channels_remap:
      -
          src: file:///tmp/a3/conda-bld
          dest: https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main
      -

          dest: https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/r

~~~~~
specs
~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``list``, ``str``,

List of package specifications, e.g. `python 2.7*`, `pyzmq` or `numpy >=1.8`.
This list of specifications if given to the conda resolver (as if you were
to create a new environment with those specs). The packages may also be
specified by their entire URL,
e.g.`https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/osx-64/openssl-1.0.2o-h26aff7b_0.tar.bz2`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
user_requested_specs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``list``, ``str``,

List of package specifications to be recorded as "user-requested" for the
initial environment in conda's history file. If not given, user-requested
specs will fall back to 'specs'.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
menu_packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``list``,

Packages for menu items will be installed (if the conda package contains the
necessary metadata in "Menu/<package name>.json").  Menu items are currently
only supported on Windows.  By default, all menu items will be installed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ignore_duplicate_files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``bool``,

By default, constructor will error out when adding packages with duplicate
files in them. Enable this option to warn instead and continue.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
conda_default_channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``list``,

You can list conda channels here which will be the default conda channels
of the created installer (if it includes conda).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
installer_filename
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``str``,

The filename of the installer being created.  A reasonable default filename
will determined by the `name`, `version`, platform and installer type.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
installer_type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``str``,

The type of the installer being created.  Possible values are "sh", "pkg",
and "exe".  By default, the type is "sh" on Unix, and "exe" on Windows.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
license_file
~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``str``,

Path to the license file being displayed by the installer during the install
process.

~~~~~~~~~
keep_pkgs
~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``bool``,

If ``False`` (default), the package cache in the ``pkgs`` subdirectory is removed
when the installation process is complete. If ``True``, this subdirectory and
its contents are preserved. If ``keep_pkgs`` is ``False``, Unix ``.sh`` and Windows ``.msi``
installers offer a command-line option (``-k`` and ``/KeepPkgCache``, respectively)
to preserve the package cache.

~~~~~~~~~~
batch_mode
~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``bool``,

Only affects ``.sh`` installers. If ``False`` (default), the installer launches
an interactive wizard guiding the user through the available options. If
``True``, the installer runs automatically as if ``-b`` was passed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
signing_identity_name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``str``,

By default, the MacOS pkg installer isn't signed. If an identity name is specified
using this option, it will be used to sign the installer. Note that you will need
to have a certificate and corresponding private key together called an 'identity'
in one of your accessible keychains.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
attempt_hardlinks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``bool``,

By default, conda packages are extracted into the root environment and then
patched. Enabling this option will result into extraction of the packages into
the `pkgs` directory and the files in the root environment will be hardlinks to
the files kept in the `pkgs` directory and then patched accordingly.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~
write_condarc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

required: False

argument type(s): ``bool``,

By default, no .condarc file is written. If set, a .condarc file is written to
