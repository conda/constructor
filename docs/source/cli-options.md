# CLI options for constructor-generated installers

The are the command-line flags available in the installers generated by constructor.

## Shell-based installers for MacOS and Linux

We have the following CLI options available for MacOS and Linux:

- `-h` (help): display the installer help message and exit.
- `-b` (batch): run the installer in batch mode without user intervention.
- `-f` (force): ignores existing installations and overwrites them.
- `-i` (interactive): run in interactive mode (default).
- `-k` (keep): do not delete the `pkgs/` cache after installation.
- `-p PREFIX` (path): installs to the given path.
- `-s` (skip): do not run any `pre/post-install` scripts.

These options are available in installers that ship the `conda` package:

- `-t` (test): can be used to run package tests after installation (it may install conda-build).
- `-u` (update): try to update an existing `conda` installation.

### Examples

Run the installer in batch mode:

```bash
$ bash my_installer.sh -b
```
Run the installer in batch mode and install to a custom path:

```bash
$ bash my_installer.sh -b -p /opt/my_app
```


## Windows installers

Windows installers have the following CLI options available:

- `/InstallationType=[JustMe|AllUsers]`: This flag sets the installation type. The default is
`JustMe`. `AllUsers` might require elevated privileges. - `/AddToPath=[0|1]`: Whether to add the
installation directory to the `PATH` environment variable. The default is `0`. This is NOT
recommended. - `/CheckPathLength=[0|1]`: Check whether the installation path is too long (>46
characters). The default depends on how the installer was created. - `/KeepPkgCache=[0|1]`: Whether
to keep the package cache or not. Defaults to `1`. - `/NoRegistry=[0|1]`: Whether to prevent
registry modification or not. Defaults to `0`. - `/NoScripts=[0|1]`: If set to `1`, the installer
will not run any post-install scripts. Defaults to `0`. - `/NoShortcuts=[0|1]`: If set to `1`, the
installer will not create any shortcuts. Defaults to `0`. - `/RegisterPython=[0|1]`: Whether to
register Python as default in the Windows registry. Defaults to `1`. This is preferred to
`AddToPath`.

You can also supply [standard NSIS flags](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Docs/Chapter3.html#installerusage), but only _after_ the ones mentioned above:

- `/NCRC`: disables the CRC check.
- `/S` (silent): runs the installer or uninstaller in silent mode.
- `/D` (directory): sets the default installation directory. Note that even if the path contains
  spaces, it must be the last parameter used in the command line and must not contain any quotes.
  Only absolute paths are supported. The uninstaller uses `_?` instead of `/D`.

### Examples:

> Note that the NSIS installers will not write any output to the terminal. You will not see any
> output, even if the installation fails. You can check the Task Manager to see if the installer is
> running, or poll the installation directory to see if the installation has finished.

Run the installer in silent mode:

```cmd
> cmd.exe /c start /wait my_installer.exe /S
```

Run the installer in silent mode and install to a custom path:

```cmd
> cmd.exe /c start /wait my_installer.exe /InstallationType=AllUsers /AddToPath=1 /S /D=C:\Program Files\my_app
```

Run the uninstaller in silent mode from its original location:

```
> cmd.exe /c start /wait "C:\Program Files\my_app\uninstaller.exe" /S _?=C:\Program Files\my_app
```

## PKG installers

The PKG installers do not offer any CLI options. Instead, you need to use the `installer`
subcommand:

```bash
$ installer -pkg my_installer.pkg -dumplog -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory
```

Note you can't choose a custom path for the installation. Instead, you can only choose a `target`.
Refer to `man installer` for more information.
