## Control which kind of installer gets generated

Constructor is currently limited to generating installers for the platform on
which it is running. In other words, if you run constructor on a Windows
computer, you can only generate Windows installers. This is largely because
OS-native tools are needed to generate the Windows `.exe` files and macOS `.pkg`
files. There is a key in `construct.yaml`, `installer_type`, which dictates
the type of installer that gets generated. This is primarily only useful for
macOS, where you can generate either `.pkg` or `.sh` installers. When not set in
`construct.yaml`, this value defaults to `.sh` on Unix platforms, and `.exe` on
Windows. Using this key is generally done with selectors.  For example, to
build a `.pkg` installer on MacOS, but fall back to default behavior on other
platforms:

```yaml
installer_type: pkg  #[osx]
```

See [`installer_type`](construct-yaml.md#installer_type) for more details.


## Customization and branding

Graphical installers (`.pkg` on macOS and `.exe` on Windows) support some level of branding and customization.

Logos, backgrounds and banners:
- Refer to [`welcome_image`](construct-yaml.md#welcome_image) and [`icon_image`](construct-yaml.md#icon_image). Windows also supports [`header_image`](construct-yaml.md#header_image).
- Alternatively, a text-based image can be autogenerated from text if you set [`welcome_image_text`](construct-yaml.md#welcome_image_text)  and [`header_image_text`](construct-yaml.md#header_image_text), respectively. The color of such text can be provided via [`default_image_color`](construct-yaml.md#default_image_color).

Messages and texts. You can specify these via `*_file` (a path is expected) or `_text` (raw string expected).
- [`welcome_file`](construct-yaml.md#welcome_file) and [`welcome_text`](construct-yaml.md#welcome_text): The text that is shown in the first page of the installer.
- [`readme_file`](construct-yaml.md#readme_file) and [`readme_text`](construct-yaml.md#readme_text): Optional text to be displayed on an extra page before the license. macOS only.
- [`conclusion_file`](construct-yaml.md#conclusion_file) and [`conclusion_text`](construct-yaml.md#conclusion_text): The text to be shown at the end of the installer, on success.

On Windows, you can also add extra pages to the installer. This is an advanced option, so your best bet is to check the examples in the source repository at `examples/customized_welcome_conclusion`.

## Signing and notarization

Windows can trigger SmartScreen alerts for EXE installers, signed or not. It does help when they are signed, though. [Read this SO answer about SmartScreen reputation for more details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48946680/how-to-avoid-the-windows-defender-smartscreen-prevented-an-unrecognized-app-fro/66582477#66582477).
In the case of macOS, users might get similar warnings for PKGs if the installers are not signed _and_ notarized. However, once these two requirements are fulfilled, the warnings disappear instantly.

`constructor` offers some configuration options to help you in this process:

- For Windows, you will need to provide the path to your code signing certificate (PFX format) in [`signing_certificate`](construct-yaml.md#signing_certificate).
- For macOS, you will need to provide two identity names. One for the PKG signature (via [`signing_identity_name`](construct-yaml.md#signing_identity_name)), and one to pass the notarization (via [`notarization_identity_name`](construct-yaml.md#notarization_identity_name)). These can be obtained in the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).
Once signed, you can notarize your PKG with Apple's `notarytool`.

```

## Create shortcuts

On Windows, `conda` supports `menuinst 1.x` shortcuts. If a package provides a certain JSON file
under `$PREFIX/Menu`, `conda` will process it to create the specified menu items.
This happens by default for _all packages_. If you only want this to happen for certain packages,
use the [`menu_packages`](construct-yaml.md#menu_packages) key.

## Find out the used constructor version

Recent constructor versions (>=3.4.2) burn-in their version into created installers in order to be able to trace back bugs in created installers to the constructor code base.

The burned-in version can be retrieved in different ways depending on the installer type:

- For `.sh` intallers (via cli): `head $installer.sh | grep "Created by constructor"`
- For `.exe` installers (via Windows Explorer): `$installer.exe` → Properties → Details → Comments, or (via cli) `exiftool $installer.exe`
- For `.pkg` installers (via cli on macOS): `xar -xf $installer.pkg -n run_installation.pkg/Scripts; zgrep -a "Created by constructor" run_installation.pkg/Scripts` or pkgutil --expand $installer.pkg extracted; grep "Created by constructor" extracted/run_installation.pkg/Scripts/postinstall`
